# AdventOfCode

Currently I've just been using `iex` to run my exercises. `iex -S mix`

```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `advent_of_code` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:advent_of_code, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
